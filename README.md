# ‚ù§Ô∏è Development inspiration

A special thanks to [**Murilo Chianfa**](https://github.com/MuriloChianfa) the owner of [**TibiaAuto12**](https://github.com/MuriloChianfa/TibiaAuto12).  
I started the bot in his honor as it was my inspiration to create the fastest tibia pixel bot using GPU, parallelism and precomputation.
