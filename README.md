# üìù Description

> Fastest Tibia PixelBot developed in python to get unlocked fps.

This bot memorizes works locating image around the screen and applies cache to avoid image redetection and thus avoid excessive cpu/gpu usage.

This bot is all based on matrix calculation, also applies parallelism and also pre-processing, as it is the only way to have maximum performance.

The main goal is to work with "microseconds" using complex algorithms, calculations, etc.

This bot also uses data structure, arrays, path finding(djkistra), among other important things to have smart decisions and gameplay.

I created this bot to learn python, to stream on twitch, to make friends, to apply my knowledgments in deep learning, path finding, matrix, etc.

I'm not going to sell subscription to this bot, but it will work on "global" and you can use it, it's at your own risk.

This BOT ins't ready yet, this bot still under construction.

Be free to use any function to create your custom bot or wait for the release of v0.
